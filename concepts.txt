Epistemic vantage

 - discussion

In blackmail, say choices are [9, 6, 5, 1] ... both agents choose 6.
So it seems like they get things *wrong*. Why?

My algorithm only works when there is no concept of superior epistemic vantage?

So, it doesn't seem to be working the way I want.

I would like to isolate the subset of problems where it does.

is_certain(x) creates a game where all possibilities are limited.

A9 -> AU9 indirectly implies A9 -> B1 ... which, combined with the game
rules, indirectly imlies B4->BU4.

Which is simply not true once we run the simulation.
